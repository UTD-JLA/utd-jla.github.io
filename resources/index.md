# Resources

# THE ABSOLUTE ESSENTIALS
These are resources you will probably *need*. Well, it's technically possible to go without them, people did learn Japanese before computers existed after all! But not using them (save for some future or current replacement for them) would be unnecessarily troublesome.


* [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - A spaced-repetition flashcard program. This is *the* way to memorize a large amount of content (all the med school students know all about this too!), and of course extremely useful for memorizing vocab, and well, just about everything. Many learners see this as the central node in the "Japanese learning software stack", since the community has developed a large number of amazing programs, discussed below, that interact with it to streamline the process.
    * [Install](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (For Android, look up AnkiDroid in F-droid or Play store)
    * [Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/)
    * You need flashcard decks for anki of course. You can use **premade decks** (see the relevant section) or create cards using a **card template**, usually by mining words from your immersion

* **Yomichan** - A pop-up dictionary browser extension which can show you definitions and other information about words just by hovering over them while holding shift. It can also integrate with Anki to create cards from the sentences you come across. You will be using this constantly for reading.
    * [Install for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomichan/)
    * [Install for chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami?hl=en-US)
    * [**How to set it up, install the needed dictionaries, etc** (from TheMoeWay)](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/)
    * Information on advanced functionality (by Tatsumoto): <https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/setting-up-yomichan>

* A text extraction method for content outside the browser (see relevant section)
* A general purpose guide
* A grammar guide

# Resources
Best ones (in my opinion ofc) are bolded

## Guides
I strongly recommend reading both of these guides, as well as the pages they link to, or at least having familiarity with what they discuss. A lot of the setup of the tools listed here is discussed in them. They are amazing resources.

* **TheMoeWay** <https://learnjapanese.moe/>
* **Tatsumoto** <https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/table-of-contents>
* **Itazuraneko** <https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/>

**BOTH OF THESE HAVE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES LISTS**. Think of what you're reading now as only an abbreviated version of them, intended to only showcase the best and most important stuff.

## Grammar

* [**Tae Kim**](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim)
* [**Japanese with Cure Dolly**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj)
* [Sakubi](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/anon/sakubi)

## Anki resources
### Premade decks
* **Kana** - if you are a beginner, you'll need to learn the kana first: <https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1233553736>
* **The Tango decks** (also known as the ankidrone starter pack) - essential vocab and grammar, roughly grouped by JLPT level. It is *strongly recommended* to complete at least the N5 deck, and possibly the N4 deck. Beyond N4 you will likely find less utility in them and will have possibly switched fully to sentence mining, but they exist all the way to N1.
    * Read more and download: <https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/basic-vocabulary#anki-deck>
    * Alternate download from TMW (it's probably the same thing): <https://learnjapanese.moe/resources/#vocabulary>
* Core 2.3K deck - an alternative if you find you need more vocab practice. Some say it has too many words which aren't worth studying. Use this only if you feel the other stuff isn't enough
    * <https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/>

### Anki card templates
You will need these to do sentence mining or create your own anki cards
* **Explanation of the types of notes** - read this to have an understanding of the terminology which will be used and the advantages and disadvantages of each type so you can make a decision: https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/discussing-various-card-templates

Both of the following can be configured to use any of the note types described in the article above.

* **jp-mining-note** - This is a relatively recent one and has quickly become a favorite of TheMoeWay community. It has a lot of features and is extremely well documented.
   * Setup tutorial, very easy to follow: <https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/>
* Tatsumoto's note types - A bit simpler <https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/AnkiNoteTypes>

### Anki addons
* Just read Tatsumoto's explanation and list, it's great: <https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/useful-anki-add-ons-for-japanese>

## JP subtitles for anime
* **kitsunekko** - download jp subtitles for anime. website goes down a lot unfortunately. <https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F>

## Text extraction
This is how you get text from your anime, visual novel, manga, etc into something you can Yomichan and interact with (including possibly adding to anki)

* A larger list of methods/resources, along with **instructions on setting up each program with jp-mining-note**: <https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/setupeverythingelse/>

### Simple videos (anime, etc)

* **mpvacious** A plugin for the video player mpv. Automatically copy subtitle text to the clipboard, which can be automatically pasted into yomichan's search page. Use keyboard shortcuts to send image and audio from the video into the most recently created anki card.
    * [Installation and usage](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious)
    * [Setup with tatsumoto's cards](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/mining-from-movies-and-tv-shows)
    * [Setup with jp-mining-note](https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/setupeverythingelse/)
* asbplayer - A browser-based application. Simpler to use but less flexible and limited to video formats supported by browser.
    * [setup](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer)

### Visual Novels
* **Textractor with exSTATic**
    * [Setup Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor)
        * Ignore the information about texthookers here; it's outdated, but the info about Textractor is good: <https://learnjapanese.moe/vn/>
    * [Setup exstatic](https://github.com/KamWithK/exSTATic/)

### Manga
* **mokuro**
    * A bit of a pain to setup, but great program. It's like asbplayer but for manga: <<https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro>
