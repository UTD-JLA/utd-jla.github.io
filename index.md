## ついて | About

UTダラス校日本語協会へようこそ！ Welcome to the Japanese Language Association! We are here to learn and practice our Japanese skills. Members range from new learners lacking any previous knowledge of the language to advanced speakers seeking to review concepts or practice conversation. The JLA will also point members to applicable resources depending on their level. Our goal is to prepare our members for their personal goals regarding the Japanese language, whether they be social, educational, or professional in nature.
